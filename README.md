DevOps Basics (Day 1)

DevOps = A culture + tools where Developers + Operations + QA work together.

Why we need it: Old methods (Waterfall, manual deployments) were slow, risky, and siloed.

CI/CD Concepts:

CI (Continuous Integration) → Developers merge code often, automated tests run.

CD (Continuous Delivery) → Code is always ready for release.

Continuous Deployment → Code is released to users automatically.

Tools Overview:

Git → Tracks code changes.

GitHub/GitLab → Team collaboration on Git.

Jenkins → Automates build/test/deploy.

Docker → Runs apps in containers (“same everywhere”).

Kubernetes → Manages many containers.

How DevOps improves collaboration: Shared tools + automation = faster delivery, fewer conflicts, continuous improvement.

 Git & Version Control (Day 2)

Git → A tool to track code history and collaborate.

How it works: Saves “snapshots” of your code, lets you go back in time.

Key concepts:

Branch → A separate line of work.

Merge → Combine changes from different branches.

Pull Request (PR) → Ask to merge code, with review.

GitHub/GitLab Workflows:

Store code online.

Collaborate with others via PRs, issues, and reviews.

Hands-on Task: Created a React app → pushed to GitHub → tracked with commits.
